My primary focus is on Data Quality Assessment projects, particularly in aviation and related industries. These projects evaluate critical dimensions of data quality such as completeness, accuracy, consistency, and validity. My work aims to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing data quality, thereby supporting informed decision-making and ensuring high data integrity.

In the coming months, Iâ€™ll be expanding this repository with additional projects covering broader topics in data analysis, including:

  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  * Advanced Data Visualization
  * Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning Applications

Stay tuned as I continue to build out this portfolio!

    Description: This project evaluates an airport and heliport database in Argentina, focusing on key data quality dimensions crucial for aviation safety and operational planning.
    Key Aspects:
        Completeness: Assess missing values in essential fields.
        Uniqueness: Identify and resolve duplicate records.
        Accuracy: Cross-validate geographic coordinates with external sources.
        Consistency: Ensure internal coherence across fields.
        Validity: Verify that all values align with aviation standards.

Each project includes a detailed analysis report with insights and recommendations for improving data quality.
